# Collection
The Collection of Python Scripts I Wrote for Daily Use Since 2014.

## Script Folder

| Name | Introduce |
|------|-----------|
| shell.py | useful shell functions (execute command and capture output, request url, etc) |
| [crond.py](https://github.com/skywind3000/collection/wiki/Script#crondpy) | Yet another crond implementation in pure python. It's very handy and useful when you want a independent crond scheduler, or you don't want to disturb system builtin crontab (eg, some nas/embed linux won't let you do this), or maybe you just want a crontab on windows. |
| echosvr.py | An udp echo server to test udp capacity |
| dosbox.py | An easy script to launch dosbox |
| emake.py | An easy to use building system |
| intel2gas.py | Convert intel assembly format to AT&T format |
| escope.py | easy to manage and query gtags files of projects in ~/.local/escope/... |
| [gobang.py](https://github.com/skywind3000/collection/wiki/Script#youdaopy) | a terminal gobang game with artificial intelligence in 900 lines |
| readkey.py | terminal keycode test, Ctrl-\ to exit |
| terminal.py | open a new terminal window and execute some commands, support windows/cygwin/ubuntu/mac osx |
| [youdao.py](https://github.com/skywind3000/collection/wiki/Script#youdaopy) | Read & lookup words with `YoudaoDict`'s builtin database (`dicten.db`/`dictcn.db` from `YoudaoDict 4.4`). Read & lookup words in `.LMS`/`.GVD` format (WenQuXing, 文曲星词典格式）. Dump word list in `.WTB` (WeiQuXing Word List）.  |
